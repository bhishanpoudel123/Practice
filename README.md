<strong>Answer:</strong> `Truncated SVD` (also known as LSA)
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Truncated SVD is specifically designed for sparse matrices and doesn't center the data (which would destroy sparsity), making it more memory-efficient and appropriate for high-dimensional sparse datasets.
